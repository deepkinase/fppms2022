        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:16px;color:#000;">Tony Hunter received his BA and PhD from the University
          of Cambridge, England, and completed postdoctoral training at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and
          the University of Cambridge. He joined the faculty of the Salk Institute in 1975, where he is currently
          Professor and Renato Dulbecco Chair in Cancer Research. In 1979, through his work on tumor viruses, he
          discovered a new class of protein kinases that phosphorylate tyrosine residues in proteins, establishing that
          dysregulated tyrosine phosphorylation by an activated tyrosine kinase can cause cancer. He and others went on
          to show that tyrosine phosphorylation is a widespread reversible protein modification essential for the
          regulation of a wide variety of cellular processes in multicellular eukaryotes, including transmembrane signal
          transduction by surface receptors. His work led to the realization that aberrant tyrosine phosphorylation is
          causal in several types of human cancer and in other diseases, and this has resulted in the successful
          development of a new class of small molecule inhibitors, known as TKIs, that target disease-causing tyrosine
          kinases, such as Gleevec, a BCR-ABL inhibitor used for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. As of
          January 2022, over 60 TKIs have been approved for clinical use worldwide. Hunter has received many prestigious
          awards for his work on tyrosine phosphorylation, and has been elected to several academic societies, including
          the US National Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society of London.
        <h3>Current Research</h3>

        <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:16px;color:#000;">The Hunter group’s main focus is on the role of protein
          phosphorylation in regulating cellular signaling events, and how aberrant phosphorylation causes cancer. His
          group also works on other types of post-translational modiﬁcations (PTMs), including ubiquitylation, where he
          discovered the RING domain class of E3 Ub ligases, and sumoylation, where he identified a class of E3
          ubiquitin ligases, STUbLs, that specifically target sumoylated proteins for ubiquitylation. For the past few
          years, he has been studying histidine phosphorylation of proteins, and has generated monoclonal antibodies
          specific for one or other of the two isoforms of phosphohistidine, which he has used to identify many new
          histidine phosphorylated proteins, and to uncover a possible role for histidine phosphorylation in liver
          cancer and neuroblastoma. Most recently, he has investigated the role of stromal cells in pancreatic cancer,
          discovering a role for the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) cytokine secreted by cancer-associated fibroblasts
          in tumor progression.

          <h3>Abstract</h3>
          <p style="text-align:justify;font-size:16px;color:#000;">Histidine phosphorylation, the so-called “hidden
            phosphoproteome”, is a poorly characterized posttranslational modification (PTM). The NME1 and NME2 NDPKs
            are putative mammalian protein-histidine kinases (HKs), opposed by three pHis phosphatases (PHPs) - PHPT1,
            LHPP, and PGAM5. Potentially, HKs/PHPs act to regulate protein function through reversible His
            phosphorylation. To study the heat/acid-labile pHis PTM in proteins, we generated and used rabbit mAbs
            recognizing the 1-pHis/3-pHis isoforms, finding increased pHis proteins in human cancer cells, and
            identifying pHis-containing proteins and tryptic peptides by MS analysis. With Michael Hall (Basel), we
            showed pHis levels are elevated in mouse and human liver tumors, correlating with reduced levels of the LHPP
            PHP, suggesting LHPP may be a tumor suppressor in HCC and that His phosphorylation can act as a cancer
            driver. We also found elevated levels of pHis proteins in neuroblastomas and in pancreatic cancer (PDAC)
            stromal cells. 60% pediatric neuroblastomas overexpress the NME1 HK, and with Peter Zage (UCSD) we
            demonstrated an increase in pHis-containing proteins in neuroblastoma cell lines, identifying ~30
            NME1-associated, pHis-positive proteins. We are studying a role for one of these in neuroblastoma cell
            invasion. In mouse PDAC tumors, IHC staining of tumor tissue showed that the tumor stromal cells contain
            high 3-pHis, contributed mostly by ATP citrate lyase and succinyl CoA synthetase.</p>
